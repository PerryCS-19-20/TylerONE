Anyone within the <a href="/eclipse-glossary#for_row27">path of totality</a> can see one of nature’s most awe-inspiring sights - a total solar eclipse. This path, where the moon will completely cover the sun and the sun's tenuous atmosphere - the <a href="/eclipse-glossary#for_row11">corona</a> - can be seen, will stretch from Lincoln Beach, Oregon to Charleston, South Carolina. Observers outside this path will still see a<a href="/eclipse-glossary#for_row26"> partial solar eclipse</a> where the moon covers part of the sun's disk.</p><p><img alt="In this series of still from 2013, the eclipse sequence runs from right to left.

Everyone in the contiguous United States, in fact, everyone in North America plus parts of South America, Africa, and Europe will see at least a partial solar eclipse, while the thin path of totality will pass through portions of 14 states. &nbsp;<br><img alt="This map shows the globe view of the path of totality for the August 21, 2017 total solar eclipse." src="/sites/default/files/globe_inset_v3.png"></p><p><em>Image Credit: NASA’s Scientific Visualization Studio<br>Figure 2- This map shows the globe view of&nbsp; the path of totality for the August 21, 2017 total solar eclipse.

Not to scale: If drawn to scale, the Moon would be 30 Earth diameters away. The sun would be 400 times that distance.</em></p><h1><strong>Where Can You See It?</strong></h1><p>You can see a partial eclipse, where the moon covers only a part of the sun, anywhere in North America (see “Who can see it?”). To see a total eclipse, where the moon fully covers the sun for a short few minutes, you must be in the path of totality. The path of totality is a relatively thin ribbon, around 70 miles wide, that will cross the U.S. from West to East.&nbsp; The first point of contact will be at Lincoln Beach, Oregon at 9:05 a.m. PDT. Totality begins there at 10:16 a.m. PDT.&nbsp; Over the next hour and a half, it will cross through Oregon, Idaho, Wyoming, Montana, Nebraska, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, and North and South Carolina.&nbsp; The total eclipse will end near Charleston, South Carolina at 2:48 p.m. EDT.&nbsp; From there the lunar shadow leaves the United States at 4:09 EDT.&nbsp; Its longest duration will be near Carbondale, Illinois, where the sun will be completely covered for two minutes and 40 seconds.<br><img alt="A map of the United States showing the path of totality for the August 21, 2017 total solar eclipse." src="/sites/default/files/usa_eclipse_map_print.jpg"><br><em>Figure 4 - A map of the United States showing the path of totality for the August 21, 2017 total solar eclipse.</em></p><p><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/eclipselive" target="_blank"><img alt="Eclipse live stream banner" src="/sites/default/files/slide_bg_1_main_video_stream_banner.jpg"></a></p><h1><strong>When Can You See It?</strong></h1><p>Times for partial and total phases of the eclipse vary depending on your location.

Both methods should produce clear images of the partial phase of an eclipse.&nbsp; <a href="https://eclipse2017.nasa.gov/safety">Click here</a>&nbsp;for eclipse viewing techniques and safety.<br><img alt="Check with local science museums, schools and astronomy clubs for eclipse glasses—or purchase an ISO 12312-2 compliant and CE certified pair of these special shades!" src="/sites/default/files/glasses.png"><br>Figure 5 - Check with local science museums, schools and astronomy clubs for eclipse glasses—or purchase an ISO 12312-2 compliant pair of these special shades!</p><p><em><img alt="This list describes when to wear your glasses and when you can safely look at the eclipse, only during totality!" src="/sites/default/files/Safety2.png"></em><br><em>Figure 6 - This list describes when to wear your glasses and when you can safely look at the eclipse, only during totality!</em></p><p><em><img alt="Sun watchers gather around telescopes fitted with white light solar filters." src="/sites/default/files/who-what-where_image1.png"></em><br>Sun watchers gather around telescopes fitted with white light solar filters.<br><em>Image Credit: NASA Kepler Mission</em></p><p><em><img alt="Using a projection method to view the sun." src="/sites/default/files/who-what-where_image2.png"></em><br>Using a projection method to view the sun.<br><em>Image Credit: NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></div></div></div> <footer> </footer></div></div></div></div>
